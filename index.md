### Interactive plots
On the following links you will find interactive plots where you can explore the topics of my thesis. 

This plot shows the most impotant keywords for each topics representation. 
[Topic Representations](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/GabrielLindelof/master_thesis_ukraine_invasion/blob/companion_website/topic_representations.html) 

This plot shows the popularity of each topic over time, often refered to as a _Dynamic Topic Model_. The values have been normalized to allow easier comparisons between topics. All topics are shown by default which can be messy, double click a topics name to deselect all other topics. Topics can then be added one by one for comparisons.
